# Timesheet Tracker
Jia and Osa from Input/Output submitted a proposal on September 30, 2020, to develop a Timesheet Tracker application that will replace the current format of [4.1] Master TECHCareers Timesheet Tracker (Master Timesheet). Master Timesheet was created using the Google Sheet platform and was released on July 15, 2020.  Since the release of the Master Timesheet, it has been inconvenient for students to use as it requires initial training, students to search their tabs and dates to enter their hours in specified columns. Additionally, instructors have difficulties tracking hours submitted by students and to analyze which student requires the most help based on hours submitted for a project. Timesheet Tracker will simplify timesheet submission for students and analyses for instructors by using a full-stack web application. 

Timesheet Tracker is part of a Capstone Project issued by TECHCareers for students to create a primary portfolio from this TECHCareers Full-Stack Software Developer Program. This project will help students to develop a professional level quality portfolio piece with the guidance from TECHCareers instructors.
